Warning:
	With the update of TaCZ, the application methods and adaptation specifications of each version of the expansion pack are different, please pay close attention.
	If the expansion pack declares to match 1.1.5 but not 1.1.4, it may be due to the new mechanism adopted. Although it can still be loaded in 1.1.4, such as the aiming position switching function between the sights, when it adopts this function, it will cause the unexpected normal display of the tube wall and the reticle.
	When using the auxiliary package for creation and public release, the author name of the auxiliary package (preferably @ to or the corresponding account profile page of the same website) and the original release webpage should be indicated in the introduction or comment area. At the same time, it should not and must not be distributed in other forms (including but not limited to re-uploading, restoring, etc.). This is mentioned or quoted in the original public distribution webpage, so when you use the expansion pack, these matters are followed by default. You have been properly informed again.
	When using assets in the expansion pack (including but not limited to models, textures, etc.) for direct use or modification, the original author or original distributor of the asset should be consulted for direct consent or authorization. If it is disclosed to the public without authorization, severe accountability may be pursued. I, AstralLin, represent only myself as an independent individual and support secondary creation, but I strongly disapprove of and do not support the unauthorized use of original assets.
	In particular, for the mobile, because they inherently lack a rendering pipeline and TaCZ is not designed for mobile phones, we are not responsible for them and do not provide any help for their use.
	If the "Invalid Player Data" problem occurs and you are unable to enter the archive, it is because the total amount of data packets mounted on your current client is too large. This can be solved by installing one of the following mods: Packets Fixer / XL Packet / XXL Packet. This is for reference only.
	In addition, because TaCZ is not yet fully developed, the side flip combo sights cannot realize its switching logic, so it is separated. Users who need it should prepare the corresponding variant of the item in their backpack for modification at any time.

How to install on your client:
	First, TaCZ expansion packs are mainly datapack (1.1.4+) or configuration (1.0.3-) files loaded in a special format. A small number of them are mods, which will be mentioned later. The former is in .zip format. At this time, it is neither an expansion packs specially for TaCZ nor a mod, nor a global data pack (datapack), nor a resource/texture pack (resourcepack). Do not apply TaC's experience to it.
	Secondly, when the expansion pack does not declare that it needs to be unzipped, do not unzip it. For those that declare that they need to be unzipped, you should choose "unzip to the current folder" instead of "unzip to the xxx folder" (generally). If there are further guidance documents, please read and follow them.
In particular, if you find that the expansion pack cannot be loaded due to CEN invalid problems during the startup process, you can try to unzip it, but at this time you should choose the opposite unzip option to the above.
Finally, the expansion pack will take effect in TaCZ within the matching version range, regardless of the version, forge or farbic.

	Obviously, the TaCZ expansion pack requires the TaCZ mod to be loaded, and the TaCZ mod does not have any necessary prerequisites except the forge core (the farbic branch is not discussed here). Please prepare the appropriate Minecraft version and forge version by yourself, and then put the TaCZ mod into the mods folder and start it once for subsequent operations.

	To apply the expansion pack for TaCZ 1.1.4 and later, please follow the steps below: When not playing the game, open the directory corresponding to your Minecraft version, find the tacz folder, move the compressed package you downloaded from here into it, and then start the game. The folder should be listed with the mods folder, config folder, etc., instead of the config/tacz folder.
	If it matches the expansion pack of TaCZ version 1.0.3 and earlier, it should be moved to the config/tacz/custom folder, and the rest of the operations remain unchanged; if you want to use it in the context of TaCZ version 1.1.4 and later, please place it in the above location and start the game of that version and enter any world that allows cheating. The chat box will remind you whether to convert the old version of the gun package to the new version format. Click [Convert]. After the conversion is completed, you can delete the old format package. You must restart the game to enable the converted new format package. If it is not reminded, it is because the format itself is not strict or you placed it incorrectly.
	In particular, for the expansion pack that matches TaCZ version 1.1.4 and later in mod form (.jar format), it should be placed in the mods folder of the corresponding version. Make sure that the debug mode is turned off, run the game, and it will be effective. The expansion pack it carries will be created in the tacz folder, and then the mod can be optionally deleted (currently deleting the mod will not have any effect).

Extended operations:
	You can completely remove certain items/remove only recipes by deleting certain folders in the data of this expansion pack.
	data/tacz folder contains the compatibility of this expansion pack with TaCZ's universal tags which make this expansion pack can be used for most expansion pack guns, so that it should not be modified under normal circumstances;
	data/apdf/recipes folder contains the recipes of the reality firearms of this expansion pack,
	data/arip/recipes folder contains the recipes of the high-performance fictional items of this expansion pack,
	data/asos/recipes folder contains the recipes of the reality sights of this expansion pack,
	data/atea/recipes folder contains the recipes of the reality muzzle devices (including bayonets), grips and stocks of this expansion pack;
	data/.../index folder contains the corresponding item core. If you want to remove this series of items, it is recommended to delete the parent of this folder directly.
