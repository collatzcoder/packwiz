#Air qualities at different heights in different dimensions, with one string applying to one dimension.
#A basic entry consists of the dimension's identifier and the default air level in that dimension.
#Furthermore the quality at different heights can be overridden by defining a height range and a corresponding quality.
#If a dimension doesn't have an entry here, it'll be assumed to be green everywhere.
#The string entries use SNBT format, like vanilla commands do.
